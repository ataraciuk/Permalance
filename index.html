			<h1>Labor Movement in the USA</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>1842: Commonwealth v. Hunt. landmark legal decision issued by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on the subject of labor unions. Prior to Hunt the legality of labor combinations in America was uncertain. In March 1842, Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw ruled that labor combinations were legal provided that they were organized for a legal purpose and used legal means to achieve their goals.</li>

				<li>1866: The National Labor Union (NLU) was the first national labor federation in the United States.</li>

				<li>1869: The Knights of Labor, the largest and one of the most important American labor organizations, was founded.</li>

				<li>1886: The American Federation of Labor (AFL), one of the first federations of labor unions, was founded</li>

				<li>1894: The Pullman Strike was a nationwide conflict in the summer of 1894 between the new American Railway Union (ARU) and railroads that occurred in the United States.</li>

				<li>1901: 17 major railway brotherhoods were in operation; they generally worked amicably with management, which recognized their usefulness.</li>

				<li>1914: Clayton Act: resumably exempted unions from the antitrust prohibition and established for the first time the Congressional principle that "the labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce." However, judicial interpretation so weakened it that prosecutions of labor under the antitrust acts continued until the enactment of the Norris-La Guardia Act in 1932.</li>

				<li>1920-1929: Sharp decline for labor movement, due to: economic prosperity, a lack of leadership within the movement, and anti-union sentiments from both employers and the government.</li>

				<li>1932: 25% unemployment.</li>

				<li>1932:  Norris-La Guardia Act, marking the first of many pro-union bills that Washington would pass in the 1930s.[71] Also known as the Anti-Injunction Bill, it offered procedural and substantive protections against the easy issuance of court injunctions during labor disputes, which had limited union behavior in the 1920s.
				The passage of the Norris-La Guardia Act signified a victory for the American Federation of Labor, which had been lobbying Congress to pass it for slightly more than five years.[71] It also marked a large change in public policy. Up until the passage of this act, the collective bargaining rights of workers were severely hampered by judicial control.</li>

				<li>1933: The National Industrial Recovery Act: Though it contained other provisions, like minimum wage and maximum hours, its most significant passage was, "Employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representative of their own choosing, and shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers."</li>

				<li>1934-1935: Two conventions to change AFL from craft unionism to industrial unionism fail. CIO is formed: Committee for Industrial Organization within the AFL to "encourage and promote organization of workers in the mass production industries" for "educational and advisory" functions.</li>

				<li>1936-1937: Flint sit-down strike that paralyzed General Motors. It enabled CIO unionization of GM and the main automobile firms (except Ford, which held out for a few years).[94]However it had negative ramifications, as the Gallup Poll reported, "More than anything else the use of the sit-down strike alienated the sympathies of the middle classes."</li>

				<li>1941: Pegler became the first columnist ever to win a Pulitzer Prize for reporting, for his work in exposing racketeering in Hollywood labor unions, focusing on the criminal career of William Morris Bioff.</li>

				<li>1947: Taftâ€“Hartley Act. Restricts the activities and power of labor unions. Labor leaders called it the "slave-labor bill"[1] while President Truman argued that it was a "dangerous intrusion on free speech",[2] and that it would "conflict with important principles of our democratic society".</li>

				<li>1955: AFL and CIO merge.</li>

				<li>1959: Laundrum-Griffin Act, more restrictions on organized labor.</li>
